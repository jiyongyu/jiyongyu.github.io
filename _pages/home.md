I am a final-year Computer Science Ph.D student at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), advised by [Prof. Chris Fletcher](https://cwfltcher.net). My research interest lies in the intersection between computer architecture and computer security, mostly about micro-architectural side-channel attacks and defenses. My work spans across building comprehensive and efficient side-channel defenses, developping new side-channel attacks on latest processors to designing trusted computing solutions.

Before joining UIUC in 2017, I graduated from both University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering (dual degree). 

**I am expecpted to graduate in 2023 Summer and currently on the industry job market!**
